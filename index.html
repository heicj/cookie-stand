            <p>Pat who is from Seattle, and where Salmon Cookies was founded, combines two signature Seattle icons, salmon and coffee.
                The cookies are made into the shape of a salmon, and are actually made with salmon (though the fish is ground up so fine that you can't even taste it!).
                They are the ideal match for a steaming cup of coffee on a PNW morning, or afternoon, or whenever. All the salmon is locally sourced (of course)
                and processed by Salmon Cookie.  Even though the salmon is indistinguishable in the cookie you get all the benefits of eating salmon; omega 3s and protein 
                
                for example.  The cookies are all made to look like a salmon, because what is a salmon cookie if not shaped like a salmon?
                This pictures are examples of some of our customers favorite cookies.
